Instead, please report them via one of the following methods:

1. **Email**: Send details to **support@ptcusa.com** with "[SECURITY]" in the subject line
2. **GitHub Security Advisory**: Use GitHub's [private vulnerability reporting](https://github.com/Pyramid-Technical-Consultants/ic256-sampler/security/advisories/new) feature

### What to Include

When reporting a security vulnerability, please include:

- A description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact
- Suggested fix (if you have one)
- Your contact information (optional, but helpful for follow-up questions)

### What to Expect

- We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 48 hours
- We will provide an initial assessment within 7 days
- We will keep you informed of our progress
- We will credit you in the security advisory (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)
